    <label for="paragraph">Did you know that all the cells in the human body are made up of 46 chromosomes? These <br>
    chromosomes make up 23 pairs that are replicated and passed on to daughter cells. The only <br>
    exception is the sperm and egg cells, each of which is made up of 23 single chromosomes. <br>
    Why do you think this is so? Think of a reason based on the role that the sperm and egg <br>
    cells play in the process of reproduction. Write your answer below.</label>
